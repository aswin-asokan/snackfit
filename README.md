### Project Description

An AI-powered app that scans your outfit, figures out which food you look like, roasts you for it, and tells you exactly where you can find that dish nearby — whether you’re at home or on a trip. Because why browse menus when you can just eat what you wear?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People waste precious minutes (sometimes hours) scrolling through endless restaurant menus, forgetting the most obvious option — eating the food they’re already dressed like. Tragic and unnecessary.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We use AI fashion-to-food matching to decide if you’re rocking “Puttu Kadala Power Look” or “Banana Fry Sunshine Fit.” Then we point you to the nearest place serving your edible twin — so you can taste-test your look in real life.
